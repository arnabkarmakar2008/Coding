2. DFS
3. Topological Sort - > Iterative (Kahn's)
                    - > Recursion

4. Shortest Path -> Dijkstar's (Single source to all destination : for 0 and +ve)
                 -> Bellman Ford (For negative cycle)
                 -> Ford Warshall (All pair shortest path)

5. MST -> Prim's
       -> Kruskal
