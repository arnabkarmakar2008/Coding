/**
 * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher
 * received for their ith paper and citations is sorted in an ascending order, return compute the researcher's
 * h-index.
 *
 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have
 * at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
 *
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.
 *
 * You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.

   * low = 1 high = 8 mid = 6. 6 is greater than n-2. So 6 is not optimal. Move high = mid-1
   * low = 1 high = 5 mid = 0. n-0 > 1. So 1 is valid answer. We need max value. So go to higher side. low = mid+1
   * low = 5 high=5 mid = 5. 5 is greater than n-1. So 6 is not optimal. Move high = mid-1.
   * low = 5 high=1 loop will exit.
   *
   * Now 1 is the valid answer but 5 is not. So possible answer could be 1,2,3,4. So answer will be
   * number of elements on the right side of array. So we have to return n-low;
