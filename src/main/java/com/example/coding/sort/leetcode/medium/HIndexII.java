 * Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher

 * According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have
 * at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.
 *
 * If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

 * You must write an algorithm that runs in logarithmic time.
